# Data Cleaning with NumPy and Pandas
let’s be honest, the vast majority of time a data scientist spends is not doing all the really cool modeling that we all wanna do, it’s doing the data prep, the manipulation, reporting, graphing… That’s 80%-90% of the job now.

Data Cleaning is also referred to as Data Wrangling, Data Munging, Data Janitor Work and Data Preparation. All of these refer to preparing data for ingestion into a data processing stream of some kind. Computers are very intolerant of format differences, so all of the data must be reformatted to conform to a standard (or "clean") format. Missing data and partial datasets can be problematic, so an initial goal is to identify data deficiencies before they lead to spurious results.

The end result may sometimes be referred to as tidy data, however it is important to remember that data cleaning is not always a one-time task. The further use of any given dataset may well highlight details that need further cleaning.
